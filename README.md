Objective of the visualization:

This project aims to provide a narrative around how urbanization across the globe in different countries is driving GDP  and mobilizing the population to certain big cities.
As a result of this the cities are getting bigger and bigger in area with each passing day and finally resulting depletion of forest area.This trend might prove harmful 
by severly damaging the environment with less forests and incresed pollution.

Narrative Structure:
 
This visualization follows the structure of an Interactive Slideshow giving the viewer capacity to navigate through different slides and the details if needed 
and understand the impact of urbanization on different aspects like GDP,Population and deforestation.

Visual Structure:

The visual structure is based on scenes .Each scene is depicted using similar kind of layout and same template for visual consistency.
The title for each scene is placed above the visualization and helps in setting up the context for visualization.
The visualization container which displays the data and is consistent with height 510px, width 980px, and background color "grey" for each scene of the narrative visualization.
the graph varies as per the requirement of the scene to convey the narrative of the data in a proper way.
The scenes were designed for consistency to keep the viewer from getting disoriented through transitions.
the order of the scenes are placed in a story telling structure.


Scenes:

There are 3 web pages along with 4  scenes originating from the 2nd page.
First page gives the context of overall project.second page provides url as per user need
to navigate to individual scenes for different queries.The second page leads to 4 more scenes based on different types visualization providing detailed coverage on 
below topics:-
1.GDP vs urban area coverage.
2.country wise urban area.
3.trend of increasing population in urban area across different countries.
4.Depletion of forest cover across different countries over range of years.
Then the final conclusive page providing the result of data visualization.

Annotations:

Annotations are used to highlight a trend in the data, direct the user to further investigate the data, and ask the user to draw a conclusion from the data. The annotations use a consistent template for font size and a bolded style.

The annotation in Scene 1 is text positioned inside the visualization container meant to highlight the primary finding of the visualization. "As Urban area increases GDP increases across all countries." When the user clicks the button to transition forward to Scene 1 or Scene 2 the annotation for Scene 1 is cleared.
The annotation in Scene 2 is text positioned inside the visualization container meant to highlight("Most developed countries have higher urban Area"). The user is invited to mouseover the data to see the trends for Cars, Trucks or SUVs independently. When the user clicks the button to navigate away to Scene 1 or forward to Scene 3 the annotation for Scene 2 is cleared.
The annotation in Scene 3 is text positioned inside the visualization container meant to highlight "Urban area population tend to increase with time". When the user clicks the button to navigate back to Scene 1 or to Scene 2 the annotation for Scene 3 is cleared.
Scene 4 annotation shows "as urbanisation increases ,deforestation increases"

Parameters:

Parameters are used to engage the user in the narrative visualization and further explore the data. The parameter used in this visualization are the embedded url's to navigate the slides .
once clicked on the embedded slides it takes the user to another scene or slide . When mousing over a data point belonging to a particular country, the pop up comes with data points related 
to that country and visualization. This allows the user to gain more information about the actual values below the visualization.this forms another set of parameter.


Triggers:

Triggers are utilized in two ways for this visualization.
one is to navigate from one scene to another scene through "mouse clicks" over the embedded web links.
And the other way they are used is to show up the pop ups whenever there is "mouse hover" over the bars in bar chat or over the circles in scatterplot.
